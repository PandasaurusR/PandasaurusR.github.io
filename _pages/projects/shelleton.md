**Shelleton** is a simple C# project skeleton with the ability to easily access and execute internal class methods from the CLI. This project is inspired by the work of [John Atten](https://github.com/TypecastException/ConsoleApplicationBase).



## Main Features

* **Simple Reflection**: Methods defined in specified classes, by default this is `DefaultCommands`, can be accessed via method name calls in the CLI. Method parameters are provided as arguments. 
* **Easy Integration**: As Shelleton itself is just another class, it can be lightly modified to work with a variety of other projects. Shelleton is currently utilised in [ScriptEx](/projects/scriptex) to provide an interface for various Windows operations. 


## Dependencies

Shelleton is written in C# as a collection of class files. There are no further dependancies.
